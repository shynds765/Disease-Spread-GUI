# Disease-Spread-GUI
This is rough simulation of the way a disease would spread throughout a poplulation.
Editable parameters include the population size, the initial number of people infected,
how long the simulation runs (days), how likely it is for people to come into contact with
each other (meant to simulate social distacing precautions), as well as the effectiveness of
a vaccine.
